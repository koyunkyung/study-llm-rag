  "summary": "This page is a list of all players who have won the men's FIFA World Cup tournament since its inception in 1930.\nParticipating teams have to register squads for each edition of the World Cup, which consisted of 22 players until 1998, then of 23 players from 2002 to 2018, and then of 26 players in 2022. Since 1978, winners' medals are given to all members of the winning squads. Prior to that, only players who were on the pitch during the final matches (or the de facto final in 1950) received medals. FIFA decided in 2007 to retroactively award winners' medals to all members of the winning squads between 1930 and 1974.\nWorld Cup winning players are among a selected few who are officially allowed to touch the FIFA World Cup Trophy with bare hands, the group also including managers who have won the competition, heads of state, and FIFA officials."
